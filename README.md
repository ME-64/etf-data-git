#### TODO

1. Implement better way to initialise cookies
1. Implement the 'smart' waiting for pages to load
1. Standardise the the required 'datapoint' name for each issuer website
1. Define each driver object for each site seperately (?)
1. Methods to get a) holdings b) historical data c) list of ISINs
1. When attr. is not found in the mapping file -> make this error better
1. Scrape with ticker not ISINs (?)
1. Sort out the "source" and "source date"
1. Learn about `assert`, `pivot`
